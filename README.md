Research Project:
Mathematics Problems in the Third Cycle
The objective of this project was to detect clues of operations, temporal expressions, and named entities that are difficult to understand or ambiguous in mathematics problems in the third cycle. For the clues of operations, a Python code was written, and for the temporal expressions and named entities, a graph software, Unitex, was used.
